Focuses for dev:
// get data successfully with paging, 10 at a time. get access key
// keep code modular with good naming

#Redfin Work Sample - Food Truck Info CLI

##Overview
This project creates a command-line interface (CLI) "show-open-food-trucks" 
that display all opening food trucks from San Francisco at the time of execution. 
The CLI only shows 10 food trucks on a paper with potentially less than 10 
food trucks on the last page. 

##Data Source
https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Schedule/jjew-r69b

##Before Running
- Node 15.0.1
- Npm 7.0.3
- Redis 6.0.8 (.tar included within the project)

##Data
The San Francisco governmentâ€™s website has a public data source of food trucks
(https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Schedule/jjew-r69b). The data
can be accessed in a number of forms, including JSON, CSV, and XML. How you access the
data is up to you, but you can find some useful information about making an API request to
this data source here (https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.sfgov.org/jjew-r69b).

##The Problem
Write a command line program that prints out a list of food trucks that are open at the
current date and current time, when the program is being run. So if I run the program at
noon on a Friday, I should see a list of all the food trucks that are open then.

##Criteria
We will primarily evaluate programs on code quality and output correctness.
For quality, we expect code to be easy to read and maintain, performant, testable and
reliable. You should submit code that you are proud to have written. However do not
include tests in your submission.
Please display results in pages of 10 trucks. That is: if there are more than 10 food trucks open,
the program should display the first 10, then wait for input from the user before displaying the
next 10 (or fewer if there are fewer than 10 remaining), and so on until there are no more food
trucks to display. Display the name and address of the trucks and sort the output alphabetically
by name.
